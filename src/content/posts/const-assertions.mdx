TypeScript's `const` assertion (`as const`) is a powerful feature that allows you to create more precise type definitions. It ensures that your values are treated as immutable and infers literal types instead of broader ones.

## What is a Const Assertion?

A `const` assertion is a TypeScript feature that tells the compiler to infer the most specific, immutable type possible for a value. When you use `as const`, TypeScript treats the value as:

1. **Read-only**: The value cannot be reassigned.
2. **Literal type**: Instead of general types like `string`, `number`, or `array`, the value is inferred as a literal type.

### Example Without `as const`

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];

// TypeScript infers the type as:
// string[]

colors.push("yellow"); // Valid, as arrays are mutable
```

### Example With `as const`

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "blue", "green"] as const;

// TypeScript infers the type as:
// readonly ["red", "blue", "green"]

colors.push("yellow"); // Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly ["red", "blue", "green"]'

```

## How Does `as const` Work?

When you use `as const`, TypeScript:

- Converts arrays into immutable tuples.
- Narrows string, number, or boolean values to their literal types.
- Marks the object or array as `readonly`, making it immutable.

### Example with Objects

```javascript
const config = {
  apiKey: "12345",
  retries: 3
} as const;

// TypeScript infers the type as:
// {
//   readonly apiKey: "12345";
//   readonly retries: 3;
// }

config.apiKey = "67890"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'apiKey' because it is a read-only property

```

## When to Use Const Assertions

### 1. Enforcing Immutability

If you want to ensure that a value cannot be modified at runtime, `as const` helps enforce immutability:

```javascript
const roles = ["admin", "editor", "viewer"] as const;

roles[0] = "user"; // Error: Index signature in type 'readonly ["admin", "editor", "viewer"]' only permits reading

```

### 2. Narrowing Types for Function Parameters

Using `as const` helps TypeScript infer the most specific type, which can improve type checking in functions:

```javascript
function setRole(role: "admin" | "editor" | "viewer") {
  console.log(role);
}

const userRole = "admin" as const;
setRole(userRole); // Valid

```

Without `as const`, `userRole` would be inferred as `string`, causing a type mismatch.

### 3. Working with Literal Types

If you’re working with unions or discriminated unions, `as const` ensures precise type inference:

```javascript
type ButtonStyle = "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary";

const buttonStyles = ["primary", "secondary", "tertiary"] as const;

type ButtonStyleType = typeof buttonStyles[number];
// ButtonStyleType is "primary" | "secondary" | "tertiary"

```

### 4. Creating Immutable Data Structures

If you want to create data structures that should never change, `as const` is a great choice:

```javascript
const errorCodes = {
  NotFound: 404,
  Unauthorized: 401,
} as const;

// TypeScript infers:
// {
//   readonly NotFound: 404;
//   readonly Unauthorized: 401;
// }

function handleError(code: typeof errorCodes[keyof typeof errorCodes]) {
  console.error(code);
}

handleError(404); // Valid
handleError(500); // Error: Argument of type '500' is not assignable

```

## Limitations of Const Assertions

1. **Only for Literals**: You can’t use `as const` with variables that are already mutable.
2. **Deep Immutability**: `as const` only applies to the first level. Nested objects or arrays remain mutable unless explicitly marked as `readonly`.

### Example:

```javascript
const nested = {
  outer: {
    inner: "value"
  }
} as const;

nested.outer.inner = "newValue"; // Valid, as 'inner' is not readonly

```

To achieve deep immutability, consider using libraries like `immer` or `deep-freeze`.
