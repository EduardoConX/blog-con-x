When building applications, understanding the distinction between **state** and **props** is crucial. Both are core concepts for managing data, but they serve different purposes.

## What Are Props?

**Props** (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to its child components. Props are:

- **Read-only**: Immutable and cannot be modified by the child component.
- **Passed down**: Always passed from parent to child.

### Example

```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Eduardo" />;
}
```

In this example, the `Greeting` component receives a `name` prop and displays it.

## What Is State?

**State** represents data that a component manages internally. Unlike props, state is:

- **Mutable**: Can be updated within the component.
- **Private**: Belongs to the component and is not accessible from outside.

### Example

```javascript
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `Counter` component manages its own `count` state and updates it when the button is clicked.

## Key Differences Between State and Props

| Feature          | Props                  | State                  |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Mutability       | Immutable              | Mutable                |
| Ownership        | Passed by parent       | Managed by component   |
| Accessibility    | Read-only in child     | Private to the component |
| Use Case         | Pass data between components | Manage internal component data |

## Combining Props and State

In many cases, components use both props and state to manage their behavior. For example:

```javascript
function Counter({ initialCount }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  return <Counter initialCount={10} />;
}
```

Here:
- The `initialCount` is passed as a **prop**.
- The `count` is managed as a **state** within the `Counter` component.

## Best Practices

### Props
1. Use props for passing static or parent-managed data.
2. Avoid modifying props within a child component.

### State
1. Use state for dynamic data that changes over time.
2. Keep state minimal and localized to the relevant component.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Mutating Props

```javascript
function Child(props) {
  props.name = "Eduardo"; // ‚ùå Do not modify props directly
  return <h1>{props.name}</h1>;
}
```

Instead, derive the modified value or pass a callback function to handle updates.

### 2. Overusing State

Avoid placing all data in state; only include what is necessary for rendering the component.

**Note**: While the principles of passing data (props) and managing local state (state) are universal in component-based frameworks, their implementations may differ. Vue and Angular add additional abstraction and tools like built-in reactivity or RxJS, which make them distinct. However, understanding these concepts in one framework makes it easier to learn others.
