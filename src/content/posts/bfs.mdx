Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm widely used in computer science. It explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

## How BFS Works

BFS works by visiting all nodes at the same level before moving deeper into the graph. This ensures that the shortest path (in an unweighted graph) is found first.

### Steps of BFS:
1. Start at a given node (source).
2. Visit all immediate neighbors.
3. Move to the next level and repeat until all nodes are visited.
4. Use a **queue** to keep track of nodes to be visited next.
5. Use a **set** or a **boolean array** to keep track of visited nodes.

## BFS Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
function bfs(graph, startNode) {
  let queue = [startNode];
  let visited = new Set();
  visited.add(startNode);

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let node = queue.shift(); // Dequeue
    console.log(node); // Process the node

    for (let neighbor of graph[node]) {
      if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
        visited.add(neighbor);
        queue.push(neighbor); // Enqueue
      }
    }
  }
}

// Example graph as adjacency list
const graph = {
  A: ['B', 'C'],
  B: ['A', 'D', 'E'],
  C: ['A', 'F', 'G'],
  D: ['B'],
  E: ['B', 'H'],
  F: ['C'],
  G: ['C'],
  H: ['E']
};

bfs(graph, 'A');
// Expected Output: A B C D E F G H
```

## BFS on a Binary Tree

BFS is commonly used to traverse binary trees level by level.

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.left = this.right = null;
  }
}

function bfsBinaryTree(root) {
  if (!root) return;
  let queue = [root];

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let node = queue.shift();
    console.log(node.value);

    if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
    if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
  }
}

// Example Tree
const root = new TreeNode(1);
root.left = new TreeNode(2);
root.right = new TreeNode(3);
root.left.left = new TreeNode(4);
root.left.right = new TreeNode(5);

bfsBinaryTree(root);
// Expected Output: 1 2 3 4 5
```

## BFS Use Cases
BFS is used in many real-world applications, including:
- **Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph** (e.g., social networks, navigation systems).
- **Web Crawlers** (search engines explore links level by level).
- **Solving Puzzles** (like finding the shortest sequence of moves in a game).
- **Network Broadcasting** (spreading information efficiently).

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(V + E)` (where `V` is vertices and `E` is edges).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(V)`, since we store visited nodes and a queue.
