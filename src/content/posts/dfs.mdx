Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph or tree. It follows a deep traversal approach, going as far as possible along one branch before backtracking.

## How DFS Works

DFS uses a **stack** (explicitly or via recursion) to track visited nodes and explore deeper paths before moving to adjacent nodes.

### Steps of DFS:
1. Start at a chosen node (root for trees, any node for graphs).
2. Mark the node as visited.
3. Recursively visit all unvisited adjacent nodes.
4. Backtrack when no unvisited adjacent nodes remain.

## DFS Implementation in JavaScript

### Recursive Approach

```javascript
function dfsRecursive(graph, node, visited = new Set()) {
  if (visited.has(node)) return;
  
  console.log(node); // Process node
  visited.add(node);
  
  for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
    dfsRecursive(graph, neighbor, visited);
  }
}

const graph = {
  A: ['B', 'C'],
  B: ['D', 'E'],
  C: ['F'],
  D: [],
  E: ['F'],
  F: []
};

dfsRecursive(graph, 'A');
// Expected Output: A B D E F C
```

### Iterative Approach (Using Stack)

```javascript
function dfsIterative(graph, start) {
  const stack = [start];
  const visited = new Set();
  
  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const node = stack.pop();
    
    if (!visited.has(node)) {
      console.log(node); // Process node
      visited.add(node);
      
      for (const neighbor of graph[node].reverse()) {
        stack.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }
}

dfsIterative(graph, 'A');
// Expected Output: A B D E F C
```

## DFS Use Cases
- **Pathfinding** (e.g., solving mazes)
- **Cycle detection** in graphs
- **Topological sorting**
- **Solving puzzles** (e.g., Sudoku, backtracking problems)

## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(V + E)` - Visits every vertex and edge once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V)` - Requires space proportional to the number of vertices.
