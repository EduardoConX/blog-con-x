Data structures are the backbone of computer science — they determine how data is stored, organized, and accessed efficiently.  
They can be broadly classified into three main categories based on how elements are arranged and related to each other.

## 1. Linear Data Structures

In **linear data structures**, elements are arranged in a sequential manner — one after another.  
Each element is connected to its previous and next element, allowing traversal in a straight line.

### Common Examples

- **Array** → A fixed-size collection of elements stored in contiguous memory.
- **Linked List** → A collection of nodes, each pointing to the next node.
- **Stack** → Follows *LIFO* (Last In, First Out) — like a stack of plates.
- **Queue** → Follows *FIFO* (First In, First Out) — like a waiting line.
- **Deque** → Double-ended queue, where you can insert or delete from both ends.

### Example

```javascript
// Stack example (LIFO)
const stack = [];
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);
console.log(stack.pop()); // 3
console.log(stack.pop()); // 2
```

**Key idea:** Data elements are ordered and accessed sequentially.

## 2. Non-Linear Data Structures

In **non-linear data structures**, data elements are not stored sequentially.  
Each element can connect to multiple others, forming hierarchical or network-like relationships.

### Common Examples

- **Tree** → Represents hierarchical relationships (e.g., folders, organization charts).
- **Graph** → Represents networks and relationships (e.g., social media connections, maps).
- **Heap** → A specialized tree structure used in priority queues.

### Example

```javascript
// Simple tree node
class Node {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.children = [];
  }
}

const root = new Node("A");
root.children.push(new Node("B"), new Node("C"));
root.children[0].children.push(new Node("D"));

/*
Tree structure:
    A
   / \\
  B   C
 /
D
*/
```

**Key idea:** Data is connected in multiple directions, not just linearly.

## 3. Hash-Based Data Structures

**Hash-based structures** use a *hash function* to compute an index (or hash code) where data is stored.  
They provide **fast lookups, insertions, and deletions** — usually in constant time (O(1)).

### Common Examples

- **Hash Table / Hash Map** → Stores key-value pairs.
- **Set / HashSet** → Stores unique elements for fast existence checks.

### Example

```javascript
// Hash Map example
const userAges = new Map();
userAges.set("Alice", 25);
userAges.set("Bob", 30);

console.log(userAges.get("Alice")); // 25
console.log(userAges.has("Charlie")); // false
```

**Key idea:** Uses hashing to quickly locate data using keys.

## Comparison Summary

| Category        | Examples                         | Organization | Common Use Case |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Linear**      | Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue | Sequential    | Ordered storage or processing |
| **Non-Linear**  | Tree, Graph, Heap                | Hierarchical  | Relationships, networks, hierarchies |
| **Hash-Based**  | Hash Map, Hash Set               | Hashed        | Fast key-based access and lookups |

Understanding the main categories of data structures helps you choose the right one for the problem at hand:
- Use **linear structures** for ordered data and sequential processing.
- Use **non-linear structures** for hierarchical or network relationships.
- Use **hash-based structures** when you need fast, key-based lookups.

Each category offers unique advantages — mastering them is key to writing efficient and scalable code.
