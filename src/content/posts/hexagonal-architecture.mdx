Hexagonal Architecture, also known as the **Ports and Adapters** pattern, is a software design principle that aims to create maintainable and flexible applications by decoupling business logic from external systems. This architecture was introduced by **[Alistair Cockburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Cockburn)** and is widely used in modern software development.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Business Logic (Domain Layer)
At the heart of Hexagonal Architecture lies the **business logic**, which represents the core functionality of the application. It is independent of frameworks, databases, or external services.

### 2. Ports (Interfaces)
Ports define how the core domain interacts with the outside world. These are **abstractions** that act as entry points or communication channels.

### 3. Adapters (Implementations)
Adapters are responsible for implementing the ports. They act as bridges between the application’s core logic and external components such as databases, APIs, or user interfaces.

## Structure of Hexagonal Architecture

The architecture is commonly visualized as a hexagon, with:

- The **core domain** at the center.
- **Ports** forming the edges of the hexagon.
- **Adapters** connecting to ports to interact with external systems.

## Benefits of Hexagonal Architecture

✅ **Separation of Concerns** - Keeps business logic isolated from infrastructure details.

✅ **Flexibility** - Allows easy replacement of external systems like databases or APIs.

✅ **Testability** - Simplifies unit testing by using interfaces for dependencies.

✅ **Maintainability** - Encourages clean and modular code.

## Example in JavaScript/TypeScript

Here’s a simple implementation using TypeScript:

```typescript
// Defining a Port (Interface)
interface PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): boolean;
}

// Implementing an Adapter (External Service)
class PayPalAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
  processPayment(amount: number): boolean {
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount} via PayPal.`);
    return true;
  }
}

// Core Business Logic
class CheckoutService {
  constructor(private paymentProcessor: PaymentProcessor) {}

  checkout(amount: number) {
    if (this.paymentProcessor.processPayment(amount)) {
      console.log("Payment successful!");
    } else {
      console.log("Payment failed.");
    }
  }
}

// Using the Adapter
const paymentAdapter = new PayPalAdapter();
const checkout = new CheckoutService(paymentAdapter);
checkout.checkout(100);
```
