The **Dutch National Flag Algorithm** is a classic algorithm introduced by *Edsger W. Dijkstra*.  
It’s used to **sort an array with three distinct elements** — typically referred to as *red*, *white*, and *blue* (or simply 0, 1, and 2).

The goal is to rearrange the array so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, and then 2s — **in one pass** and **without extra memory**.

## The Idea

Imagine you have an array containing three types of elements:  
`[2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 2]`

The algorithm maintains **three pointers**:
- `low` → marks the boundary for 0s  
- `mid` → the current element being examined  
- `high` → marks the boundary for 2s  

### Algorithm steps:

1. Initialize:
- low = 0
- mid = 0
- high = array.length - 1
2. While `mid <= high`:
- If the element is **0**, swap it with `arr[low]`, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
- If the element is **1**, just move `mid` forward.
- If the element is **2**, swap it with `arr[high]` and decrement `high`.

This ensures that:
- All 0s are before `low`
- All 1s are between `low` and `mid`
- All 2s are after `high`

## Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
function dutchNationalFlag(arr) {
let low = 0;
let mid = 0;
let high = arr.length - 1;

while (mid <= high) {
 if (arr[mid] === 0) {
   [arr[low], arr[mid]] = [arr[mid], arr[low]];
   low++;
   mid++;
 } else if (arr[mid] === 1) {
   mid++;
 } else {
   [arr[mid], arr[high]] = [arr[high], arr[mid]];
   high--;
 }
}

return arr;
}

// Example usage
const colors = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0];
console.log(dutchNationalFlag(colors));

// Expected Output:
// [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
```

## Why It Works

The algorithm ensures **partitioning** of the array into three sections in a single traversal:
- `[0 ... low-1]` → All 0s  
- `[low ... mid-1]` → All 1s  
- `[high+1 ... end]` → All 2s  

It’s a simple yet powerful application of the **three-way partitioning** concept.

## Time and Space Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|------------|-------------|
| **Time** | O(n) — single pass through the array |
| **Space** | O(1) — in-place sorting |

## Common Use Cases

- Sorting arrays of **0s, 1s, and 2s**  
- Categorizing elements into **three groups** (e.g., low, medium, high)
- Simplifying **partitioning logic** in quicksort
