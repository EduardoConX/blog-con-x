A **deque** (short for **double-ended queue**) is a versatile data structure that allows insertion and removal of elements from both ends. Unlike stacks (LIFO) and queues (FIFO), deques are more flexible and can serve as both.

## Key Characteristics of Deques

1. **Bidirectional Operations**: Elements can be added or removed from both the front and the rear.
2. **Dynamic Size**: The size of a deque adjusts dynamically as elements are added or removed.
3. **Efficient Operations**: Deques typically provide `O(1)` time complexity for insertion and deletion at both ends.

## Common Operations

| Operation        | Description                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `pushFront`      | Adds an element to the front of the deque.  |
| `pushBack`       | Adds an element to the back of the deque.   |
| `popFront`       | Removes and returns the front element.      |
| `popBack`        | Removes and returns the back element.       |
| `peekFront`      | Retrieves the front element without removing it. |
| `peekBack`       | Retrieves the back element without removing it. |

## Example: Basic Implementation

```javascript
class Deque {
    constructor() {
        this.items = [];
    }

    // Add to the front
    pushFront(element) {
        this.items.unshift(element);
    }

    // Add to the back
    pushBack(element) {
        this.items.push(element);
    }

    // Remove from the front
    popFront() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            throw new Error("Deque is empty");
        }
        return this.items.shift();
    }

    // Remove from the back
    popBack() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            throw new Error("Deque is empty");
        }
        return this.items.pop();
    }

    // Check the front element
    peekFront() {
        return this.isEmpty() ? undefined : this.items[0];
    }

    // Check the back element
    peekBack() {
        return this.isEmpty() ? undefined : this.items[this.items.length - 1];
    }

    // Check if the deque is empty
    isEmpty() {
        return this.items.length === 0;
    }
}

// Example Usage
const deque = new Deque();
deque.pushFront(10);
deque.pushBack(20);
deque.pushFront(5);

console.log(deque.popBack());  // Output: 20
console.log(deque.popFront()); // Output: 5
console.log(deque.peekFront()); // Output: 10

```

## Applications of Deques

Deques are highly versatile and find applications in various scenarios, including:

1. **Sliding Window Problems**: Efficiently maintaining the maximum or minimum within a sliding window.
2. **Palindrome Checking**: Comparing elements from both ends.
3. **Undo/Redo Operations**: Maintaining a history of changes for quick navigation.
4. **Scheduling Algorithms**: Simulating tasks that require dynamic priority changes.

### Example: Sliding Window Maximum

```javascript
function maxSlidingWindow(nums, k) {
    const deque = [];
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Remove indices that are out of the current window
        if (deque.length && deque[0] < i - k + 1) {
            deque.shift();
        }

        // Remove smaller values as they won't contribute to the maximum
        while (deque.length && nums[deque[deque.length - 1]] < nums[i]) {
            deque.pop();
        }

        // Add the current index
        deque.push(i);

        // Add the maximum to the result once the window size is reached
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            result.push(nums[deque[0]]);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(maxSlidingWindow([1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], 3)); // Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]

```

## Built-in Support in Programming Languages

Languages like Python, C++, and Java offer built-in support for deques:

- **Python**: `collections.deque`
- **C++**: `std::deque`
- **Java**: `ArrayDeque`

These implementations provide optimized operations and additional functionality, making them ideal for performance-critical applications.

## Implementing Deques in JavaScript

While JavaScript does not provide a built-in `Deque` class, the `Array` can be used to simulate a deque effectively.
