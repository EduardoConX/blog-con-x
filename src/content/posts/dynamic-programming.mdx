Dynamic Programming (DP) is an optimization technique used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems and storing their results to avoid redundant computations.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Optimal Substructure
A problem has an **optimal substructure** if its solution can be composed of the optimal solutions of its subproblems.

### 2. Overlapping Subproblems
A problem has **overlapping subproblems** if the same smaller problems are solved multiple times.

## Approaches to Dynamic Programming

### Memoization (Top-Down Approach)
Memoization involves solving the problem recursively and storing results to avoid recomputation.

```javascript
function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  if (memo[n]) return memo[n];
  
  memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
  return memo[n];
}

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // Expected Output: 55
```

### Tabulation (Bottom-Up Approach)
Tabulation uses an iterative approach to build the solution from the ground up.

```javascript
function fibonacciTab(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  let dp = [0, 1];
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
  }
  return dp[n];
}

console.log(fibonacciTab(10)); // Expected Output: 55
```

## Common Problems Solved with DP
- Fibonacci Sequence
- Knapsack Problem
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Coin Change Problem

## When to Use Dynamic Programming
Use DP when:
1. The problem can be broken into smaller subproblems.
2. The subproblems overlap (same computation appears multiple times).
