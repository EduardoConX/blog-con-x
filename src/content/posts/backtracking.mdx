Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally. If a partial solution violates the constraints of the problem, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different path.

## How Backtracking Works

Backtracking explores all possible solutions in a structured manner. It follows these steps:
1. Start with an empty solution.
2. Add elements to the solution while ensuring constraints are met.
3. If a constraint is violated, remove the last added element (backtrack) and try another option.
4. Repeat until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

## Backtracking Implementation

### Example: Solving the N-Queens Problem
The N-Queens problem involves placing `N` queens on an `N x N` chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

```javascript
function solveNQueens(n) {
  const solutions = [];
  const board = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill('.'));
  
  function isSafe(row, col) {
    for (let i = 0; i < row; i++) {
      if (board[i][col] === 'Q') return false;
      if (col - (row - i) >= 0 && board[i][col - (row - i)] === 'Q') return false;
      if (col + (row - i) < n && board[i][col + (row - i)] === 'Q') return false;
    }
    return true;
  }
  
  function backtrack(row) {
    if (row === n) {
      solutions.push(board.map(r => r.join('')));
      return;
    }
    
    for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
      if (isSafe(row, col)) {
        board[row][col] = 'Q';
        backtrack(row + 1);
        board[row][col] = '.';
      }
    }
  }
  
  backtrack(0);
  return solutions;
}

console.log(solveNQueens(4));
```

## Applications of Backtracking
- **Combinatorial Problems**: Generating subsets, permutations, and combinations.
- **Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: Solving Sudoku, N-Queens, and crossword puzzles.
- **Pathfinding Problems**: Finding a path in a maze.

## When to Use Backtracking
- When the problem requires exploring multiple possibilities.
- When a brute-force solution is too slow.
- When constraints limit the number of valid solutions.
