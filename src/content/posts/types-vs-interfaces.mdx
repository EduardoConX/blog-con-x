TypeScript provides two powerful tools for defining the shapes of objects: **types** and **interfaces**. While they share many similarities, there are critical differences that can influence which one to use in specific scenarios.

## Similarities

Both **types** and **interfaces** allow you to define the structure of an object or function.

### Example of an Interface

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

### Example of a Type Alias

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

Both examples define a shape for a `User` object, and both can be used interchangeably in many cases:

```typescript
const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com"
};
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Extending and Implementing

- **Interfaces**:
  - Can be extended using the `extends` keyword.
  - Can be implemented by classes.

```typescript
interface Animal {
  name: string;
}

interface Dog extends Animal {
  breed: string;
}

class GoldenRetriever implements Dog {
  name = "Buddy";
  breed = "Golden Retriever";
}
```

- **Types**:
  - Use intersection (`&`) to combine multiple types but cannot be implemented by classes.

```typescript
type Animal = {
  name: string;
};

type Dog = Animal & {
  breed: string;
};

const myDog: Dog = {
  name: "Buddy",
  breed: "Golden Retriever"
};
```

### 2. Declaration Merging

- **Interfaces**:
  - Can be merged, allowing you to add new properties to an existing interface.

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
}

interface User {
  name: string;
}

// Merged result:
// interface User {
//   id: number;
//   name: string;
// }

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "John Doe"
};
```

- **Types**:
  - Cannot be merged. Defining the same type twice results in a compiler error.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
};

type User = {
  name: string; // Error: Duplicate identifier 'User'
};
```

### 3. Usage in Complex Scenarios

- **Interfaces**:
  - Better suited for defining object shapes and class contracts.

- **Types**:
  - More flexible, allowing unions, intersections, and primitive types.

```typescript
type ID = string | number;
type Callback = () => void;

```

## When to Use What

### Use Interfaces When:
- You need to define an object shape or a contract for a class.
- You plan to extend or merge declarations.

### Use Types When:
- You need more flexibility, such as working with unions or intersections.
- You want to alias complex types, such as function signatures or tuples.

```typescript
type Point = [number, number];
type Comparator = (a: number, b: number) => boolean;
```
