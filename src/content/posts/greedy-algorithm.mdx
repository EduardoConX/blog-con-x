The **Greedy Algorithm** is a problem-solving approach that makes a sequence of choices, each of which looks best at the moment. It is widely used in optimization problems where the goal is to find the best possible solution under given constraints.

## How Does It Work?

The greedy algorithm works by following these steps:

1. **Make a greedy choice**: Select the option that seems best at the current step.
2. **Reduce the problem**: After making a choice, update the problem to reflect the remaining subproblem.
3. **Repeat**: Continue until no further choices can be made.

> Note: Greedy algorithms do not always guarantee the globally optimal solution but are effective for specific types of problems.

## Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms

- **Greedy Choice Property**: A global solution can be arrived at by choosing a local optimum.
- **Optimal Substructure**: An optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

## Examples

### Example 1: Coin Change Problem

Given a set of coin denominations and a total amount, find the minimum number of coins required.

```javascript
function minCoins(coins, amount) {
    coins.sort((a, b) => b - a); // Sort coins in descending order
    let count = 0;

    for (let coin of coins) {
        while (amount >= coin) {
            amount -= coin;
            count++;
        }
    }

    return amount === 0 ? count : -1; // Return -1 if exact amount cannot be made
}

const coins = [1, 5, 10, 25];
console.log(minCoins(coins, 37)); // Output: 4 (25 + 10 + 1 + 1)

```

### Example 2: Activity Selection Problem

Select the maximum number of activities that do not overlap.

```javascript
function activitySelection(activities) {
    activities.sort((a, b) => a.end - b.end); // Sort by end time

    let selected = [];
    let lastEnd = 0;

    for (let activity of activities) {
        if (activity.start >= lastEnd) {
            selected.push(activity);
            lastEnd = activity.end;
        }
    }

    return selected;
}

const activities = [
    { start: 1, end: 3 },
    { start: 2, end: 5 },
    { start: 4, end: 6 },
    { start: 6, end: 7 },
    { start: 5, end: 9 }
];

console.log(activitySelection(activities));
// Output: [{ start: 1, end: 3 }, { start: 4, end: 6 }, { start: 6, end: 7 }]

```

## Use Cases

Greedy algorithms are particularly useful in:

1. **Scheduling problems** (e.g., activity selection, job scheduling).
2. **Graph problems** (e.g., [Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm), [Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)).
3. **Optimization problems** (e.g., [fractional knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_knapsack_problem)).

## Advantages

- Simple to implement.
- Efficient for problems that satisfy greedy choice property and optimal substructure.
- Often faster than other approaches like dynamic programming.

## Disadvantages

- Does not always provide the globally optimal solution.
- Requires careful analysis to determine if the problem is suitable for a greedy approach.
