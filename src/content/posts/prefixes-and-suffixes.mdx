When it comes to solving algorithmic problems, prefixes and suffixes often play a crucial role in simplifying complex computations and optimizing performance. These concepts aren't just theoretical—they're practical tools used in a wide range of programming tasks, from string manipulation to dynamic programming and more.

## What Are Prefixes and Suffixes?

### Prefix
A **prefix** is a substring that starts at the beginning of a string and ends at any position within the string. For example:

```plaintext
String: "programming"
Prefixes: "p", "pr", "pro", "prog", ..., "programming"
```

### Suffix
A **suffix** is a substring that ends at the end of a string and starts at any position within the string. For example:

```plaintext
String: "programming"
Suffixes: "g", "ng", "ing", "ming", ..., "programming"
```

## Why Are Prefixes and Suffixes Useful?

1. **Search Optimization**: Prefixes are essential for building **[prefix trees (tries)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie).**, which are data structures that enable efficient searching, especially in dictionary-like scenarios or autocomplete systems.

2. **Pattern Matching**: Both prefixes and suffixes are integral to string matching algorithms like the **[Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm).** algorithm, which uses a prefix-suffix table to skip unnecessary comparisons.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Prefix sums and suffix sums help break down problems into smaller, manageable parts. For example:
   - **Prefix sum**: Helps compute cumulative sums quickly for range queries.
   - **Suffix sum**: Similarly helps in problems where you need cumulative sums from the end of a list.

## Common Applications

### 1. String Matching
Finding occurrences of one string (pattern) within another can be optimized using the concept of prefix-suffix matches. The KMP algorithm builds a prefix table to find overlaps between a string and its prefixes and suffixes.

### 2. Subarray Problems
Prefix sums make range queries efficient. For instance, given an array, you can compute the sum of any subarray using:

```plaintext
prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i - 1]
```
where `i` and `j` are the bounds of the subarray.

### 3. Palindrome Problems
To find the longest palindromic prefix or suffix in a string, algorithms like Manacher’s algorithm or dynamic programming leverage the properties of prefixes and suffixes.

### 4. Text Completion and Suggestion
Autocomplete systems use tries to store prefixes of words, enabling fast lookups for partial strings.

## Code Examples

### Prefix Sum

```python
def calculate_prefix_sum(arr):
    prefix_sum = [0] * len(arr)
    prefix_sum[0] = arr[0]
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + arr[i]
    return prefix_sum

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_prefix_sum(arr))  # Output: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
```

### Suffix Sum

```python
def calculate_suffix_sum(arr):
    suffix_sum = [0] * len(arr)
    suffix_sum[-1] = arr[-1]
    for i in range(len(arr) - 2, -1, -1):
        suffix_sum[i] = suffix_sum[i + 1] + arr[i]
    return suffix_sum

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(calculate_suffix_sum(arr))  # Output: [15, 14, 12, 9, 5]
```
